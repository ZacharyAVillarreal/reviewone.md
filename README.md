## Summary


  Borderlands is a first person RPG shooter with an cartoon art style. The game is about a group of vault hunters looking for the myth that is the vault on a planet called pandora. The vault is said to have unheard of treasure. The player faces threats from the environment from creatures like slags and rakks, as well has human threats like raiders and the crimson lance which is a military group. As the player gets closer to discovering the vault enimies grow in power and the players arsenal also grows in power. The game includes a lot of guns, each having different stats and damage types. The player can have 4 guns equipment and has a backpack that the player can upgrade the compacity as the game goes on to hold more guns. 
  
   Borderlands is playable up to 4 players and each person can choose one of 4 classes. The 4 classes have different abilities and are proficient with different weapons. The berserk is better with melee and explosives, this class is optimal for close range play starting with a shotgun and multiple perks that increase stats of melee and explosives. The berserk's ability is to go berserk, the screen turns red and the player gets a speed boost and both fist are brought up. The player then can run up and melee enemies with increased damage and take reduced damage. The hunter class is proficient with sniper rifles and pistols with multiple perks increasing stats of both. The hunter's ability is to throw a bird like creature out that will attack near by enemies on its own. The siren's class is based on light submachine guns and elemental damage weapons. The siren's ability is to phase walk, being undedectable by enemies and able to move with increased movement speed. When the phase walk ends a small shock wave is released damaging nearby enemies. The soldier class is better with rifles and shotguns. The soldier's ability is to deploy a small turret with a shield that blocks bullets. The turret will attack enemies and can be upgraded through the soldiers perk tree to increase damage or help teamates with a ring that heals and gives ammo.
 
  The game is almost open world in that the player is put into a medium sized map that can be explored but most quest in the main town will lead the player to most of the map. Once the player has progressed enough the next area will be unlocked and the player can then travel between areas through a loading screen. There are almost 40 location in borderlands that the player can unlock and travel to using a fast travel system that can be accessed at fast travel points. 
 


## Final Thoughts
  I liked how the game was playable up to 4 people and the game grew in difficulty the more you included. The game had a long play time with lots of quest to be done with hours of play time. With great replayablity. The game was the first of its kind so the whole game is more of a test from the developers to see how the this style of game will be, so lots more could have been included in the story. We do see it in the later Borderlands games to come out, this is noticeable because the game's story can seem dull and pointless at points. Overall I do think Borderlands is a great game, I have played the game multiple times over with each class and played through the multiple DLC that came out later. The game is great and even better with friends to play with.
