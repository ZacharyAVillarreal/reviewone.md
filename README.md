This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Borderlands is a first person RPG shooter with an cartoon art style. The player is given multiple quest to from NPCs and bounty boards. The mission type include go and collect and kill or destory this target. 

  Borderlands is playable up to 4 players and each person can choose one of 4 classes. The 4 classes have different abilities and are proficient with different weapons. The berserk is better with melee and explosives, this class is optimal for close range play starting with a shotgun and multiple perks that increase stats of melee and explosives. The berserk's ability is to go berserk, the screen turns red and the player gets a speed boost and both fist are brought up. The player then can run up and melee enemies with increased damage and take reduced damage. The hunter class is proficient with sniper rifles and pistols with multiple perks increasing stats of both. The hunter's ability is to throw a bird like creature out that will attack near by enemies on its own. The siren's class is based on light submachine guns and elemental damage weapons. The siren's ability is to phase walk, being undedectable by enemies and able to move with increased movement speed. When the phase walk ends a small shock wave is released damaging nearby enemies. The soldier class is better with rifles and shotguns. The soldier's ability is to deploy a small turret with a shield that blocks bullets. The turret will attack enemies and can be upgraded through the soldiers perk tree to increase damage or help teamates with a ring that heals and gives ammo.
  The game is almost open world in that the player is put into a medium sized map that can be explored but most quest in the main town will lead the player to most of the map. Once the player has progressed enough the next area will be unlocked and the player can then travel between areas through a loading screen. There are almost 40 location in borderlands that the player can unlock and travel to using a fast travel system that can be accessed at fast travel points. 
  The game is about a group of vault hunters looking for the myth that is the vault on a planet called pandora. The vault is said to have unheard of treasure.
